# About me

### å—¨! / Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This is QTÃ˜, a developer over at Girl(s) And Scary (Lead by @CHonesetDoPa). I occasionally write scripts and short stories, I also make some really awful music.

We're creating a visual novel, but it might take a while, so buckle up, this is going to be a *long long* wait ~~(Long long maaaaaaaaan)~~

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on some interesting projects in Girl(s) And Scary, I'm also doing some cool things for my school, and doing some personal projects (not programming related).
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning competitive programming to enter [*Olimpiada de InformÃ¡tica EspaÃ±ola*](https://olimpiada-informatica.org/)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: qtnull@ccloud.cf (You can reach me for collaborations, contructive criticisms, anything)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronoun: he/him
- âš¡ Games that I like: <span title="someone I knew dragged me into this rabbit hole">**_Genshin Impact_**</span>, Euro Truck Simulator 2, *a truckload of visual novels*, osu!
- Languages that I speak: Chinese, Spanish, English ~~(Obviously lol)~~, a few words in german, french and japanese.

Girl(s) And Scary are looking for visual novel ideas, writers, illustrators, artists, music producers, and more programmers, reach us by sending an e-mail: qtnull@ccloud.cf

My *Motto*: *Carpe diem, tempus fugit* (As the time flies, enjoy the present)
